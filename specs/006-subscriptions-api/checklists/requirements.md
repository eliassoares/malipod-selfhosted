# Specification Quality Checklist: Subscriptions API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](/Users/eliassoares/Documents/projects/personal/malipod/specs/006-subscriptions-api/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- External route shapes, status codes, and payload formats are treated as
  product compatibility requirements rather than internal implementation
  guidance.
- The spec intentionally separates full-device replacement from delta
  synchronization so planning can preserve independent slices and validation.
- JSONP support is retained only as an externally visible contract behavior for
  compatible clients and does not prescribe internal rendering mechanics.
